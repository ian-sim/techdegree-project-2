 List Pagination and Filtering

This project takes a html file with a long list of list items all displayed on one page and employs pagination and filtering to make the page more user friendly.

I have gone for the 'exceeds expectations' grade by also adding search functionality to allow the user to search for students whilst still using pagination to display the search results.
